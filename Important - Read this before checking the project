Please accept my apologies for late submission.It took me some time because I had to design the whole framework 
from scratch and since I was travelling a day before, I could not complete it on time.

1. In the first question, it was asked to confirm if the test contains "Chemtrails", but it actually contained the text "chemtrails" due to 
which the string had to be converted to lowercase
2. In the second question, it was asked to confirm if the image title contained the phrase "Dealey plaza" but it actually contained 
daily_plaza. So the test case returns false
3. In the third question, it was asked to check the title of Street View option.

Several improvements can be made in the code if provided sufficient time.
